    <p>History &amp; Concept: Explain how the idea for the business came about, leveraging the family’s collective expertise for both client work and community support.
VARoadstter started with a couple of “boys” and a car. Hal wanted a TT Roadster enough to teach Wendy stick shift on it. 2 year old Matt would drag his car seat with joy to his Dad’s car when it was time for him to take him to preschool in the TT. Eventually the TT had to be traded in for a Chevy truck when the family grew in size and wendy observed that when the van was in the shop, the family wouldnt all fit in the TT. 
Matt never lost his love of cars. So when he expressed an interest in a career in Motorsports, Wendy started to dream.what if. 
Charlie got involved with FRC robotics during their Junior year in highschool. WhenWendy wouldn’t stop asking questions about the autonomous program, they invited her to join Senior year as a mentor. Charlie is studying Chemistry at UNC Charlotte while Wendy has continued to mentor Team Firewall.
Hal has been developing mobile apps for a variety of problem spaces for 15 years.
We’ve always been a family of makers, creators, and problem solvers. VARoadstter Consulting has been a percolation of combined passions and interests.</p>
